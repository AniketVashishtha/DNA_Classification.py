# DNA_Classification.py
Created a modelto classify short E. coli DNA sequences by using Markov models, K-nearest neighbour(KNN) algorithms, support vector machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Network, Adaboost, Naive Bayes to see which model gave the best results for this classification tasks. The Dataset was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository hat has 106 DNA Sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides each.
